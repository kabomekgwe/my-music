# Augment Rules Index

This directory contains focused rule files that guide development practices for the my-music project. Each rule file is designed to be automatically detected and applied by Augment based on the context of your work.

## Rule Types

- **Always**: Applied to every conversation and code generation
- **Auto**: Automatically detected and applied based on file context
- **Manual**: Must be manually referenced with @rule-name

## How to Use These Rules

### Automatic Application
Most rules are automatically applied based on your current work context:
- Working on React components ‚Üí `nextjs-frontend.md` rules apply
- Working on NestJS controllers ‚Üí `nestjs-backend.md` rules apply
- All security and naming rules are always active

### Manual Reference
For specific guidance, reference rules manually:
```
@performance-standards - for optimization guidance
@decision-frameworks - for architectural decisions
@project-setup - for setup and configuration help
```

### Rule Priority
1. **Always** rules (security, naming, TypeScript) - highest priority
2. **Auto** rules (framework-specific) - applied based on context
3. **Manual** rules (performance, decisions) - applied when referenced

## Rule File Structure

Each rule file follows this structure:
```markdown
# Rule Title

**Type**: Always|Auto|Manual
**Description**: Brief description of what this rule covers

## Section 1
- Specific, actionable guidelines
- Clear do/don't statements
- Code examples where helpful

## Section 2
- More guidelines...
```

## Updating Rules

When updating rules:
1. Keep rules specific and actionable
2. Use clear examples for complex patterns
3. Maintain the Type designation for proper application
4. Update this index if adding new rule files

## Quick Reference

| Rule File | Type | Primary Use Case |
|-----------|------|------------------|
| `security-critical.md` | Always | Authentication, validation, security patterns |
| `database-api-standards.md` | Always | Database schema, API design, service patterns |
| `naming-conventions.md` | Always | File and variable naming standards |
| `typescript-standards.md` | Always | Type safety and TypeScript configuration |
| `testing-requirements.md` | Always | Testing coverage and patterns |
| `nextjs-frontend.md` | Auto | React/Next.js development |
| `nestjs-backend.md` | Auto | NestJS backend development |
| `performance-standards.md` | Manual | Performance optimization |
| `decision-frameworks.md` | Manual | Architectural decision guidance |
| `project-setup.md` | Manual | Project initialization and setup |

## Integration with .augment-guidelines

These rule files are extracted and organized from the main `.augment-guidelines` file to provide:
- Better organization and maintainability
- Context-aware rule application
- Focused guidance for specific development tasks
- Easier updates and modifications

The original `.augment-guidelines` file remains as a comprehensive reference, while these focused rule files provide targeted guidance during development.
